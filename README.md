# CreditCardFraudDetection
This problem is an example of anomaly detection in machine learning. The dataset is highly imbalanced. Due to its high imbalance IsolationForest Algorithm and LocalOutlierFactor Algorithm is used. Both these algorithm perform very well as compared to other native algorithm on an imbalanced dataset.The accuracy produced is 99.7% with precision of Valid Cases as 1.0 and Fraud Cases as 0.34 for IsolationForest Algorithm which was proved to be better than LocalOutlierFactor Algorithm.
